# Overview

For this project, I wanted to deepen my understanding of Kotlin and explore how it features. My goal was to practice writing clean, organized code while experimenting with Kolin's syntax and language features.

I development a Simple Note-Taking APP in Kotlin. The software allows users to create, edit, delete, and view notes. Each note contains a title and content, and notes are stored in a mutable list. The app demonstrates my understanding of Kotlin's object-oriented concepts, such as classes and functions, as well as how to handle user input and control program flow.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice implementing a real-world, interactive application in Kotlin and to explore how Kotlin's syntax can make coding impler and more expressive.

# Development Environment

I development this software using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, which provides excellent support for Kotlin development, including code completing, debugging, and running applications.

The programing language used was Kotlin, and the project relied on standard Kotlin libraries for collection. No external libraries were required for this simple note-taking application, making it easy to focus on Kotlin's core language features.

# Future Work


- Implement a search feature to quickly find notes by title or content.
- Including note categorization or tagging for better organization.
- Add storing and filtering option.
